### What I learned

This is a really challenging project for me. I have been abusing frontend libraries like bootstrap, so this is my first time dealing with media queries, as well as positioning components to it's position. Stylus really help a lot with writing the code and nesting in the media queries, so I was able to save a lot of time.

I'm pretty proud that I was able to write css without and library. I hope my work flow will be faster as I get used to doing CSS.
